The file was running on terminal with: 
g++ /System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/GLUT /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/OpenGL simplePolygon.cpp

Usage: 1.) left click to select and draw lines, after finish, click on the right mouse button. 
	2.) And the last right click(point) will determine whether (the point) is inside or outside the polygon. 
	3.) After a polygon is created, it shows in terminal console about wether it is a simple polygon. 
	4.) (partially done) translation.

Implementaion: I used midpoint algorithm to draw lines by a string of dots, and determine the position of each lines(in which quadrant) and translate variable to fit in a proper one (by reflection, shifting and etc.)

	And then I used algorithm to scan to polygon.
